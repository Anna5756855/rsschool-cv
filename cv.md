## About
Having worked for about 3 years as a Customer service specialist, I decided to change my life and took the path of entrepreneurship. Since 2020 I've had a small online shop of handmade products and received orders all around the world. A couple of years ago I thought of creating a website on my own - and this is how my interest in programming grew and developed.  
My current aim is to obtain necessary knowledge in programming and to start working as a Frontend Developer.

I believe that my creativity and my entrepreneur experience will help me to become a proficient Frontend Developer. I am a quick learner and an independent and responsible person.

## Code example:
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

```
function DNAStrand(dna){
  let letters = { "A": "T", "T": "A", "C": "G", "G": "C" };
  return dna.split("").map(item => letters[item]).join("") 
}
```
