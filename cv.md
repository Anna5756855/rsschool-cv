## Education:

Faculty of Romanic Languages, Linguistics

## Code example:
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

```
function DNAStrand(dna){
  let letters = { "A": "T", "T": "A", "C": "G", "G": "C" };
  return dna.split("").map(item => letters[item]).join("") 
}
```
## Language:
* Russian — Native  
* English — C2 — Proficiency  
* French — A1 — Basic
